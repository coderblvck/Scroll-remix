## Introduction

The Block Capsule is a Solidity-based Ethereum smart contract that provides various functionalities such as token transfers, minting, burning, pausing, vesting, and emergency stop mechanism.

## Functionalities

1. **Token Transfers**: Users can transfer tokens to other addresses.

2. **Minting and Burning**: The owner can create new tokens (mint) and destroy existing tokens (burn).

3. **Pausing and Unpausing**: The owner can pause and unpause the contract.

4. **Locking and Vesting**: The owner can lock tokens for vesting and release them after a specified period.

## Security Measures

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: The contract uses a state machine pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.

2. **Emergency Stop Mechanism**: The owner can trigger an emergency stop to pause the contract.

3. **Gas Optimization**: Functions that do not modify the state are marked as `view` for gas optimization.

4. **Input Validation**: Functions for minting and locking tokens validate input to ensure it's greater than zero.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To deploy and interact with this contract, you'll need:

- Truffle or Remix IDE for smart contract development.
- An Ethereum wallet and some test Ether for deploying on a testnet.
- Node.js and npm for project setup.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
